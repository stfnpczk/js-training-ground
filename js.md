## Promises
Promises are objects that represent the eventual outcome of an **asynchronous operation** and its resulting value. 
A Promise object can be in one of these **three states**:

  - **pending**: initial state, the operation has not completed yet, neither fulfilled nor rejected
  - **fulfilled**: operation was completed successfully. Promise has settled and now has a resolved value.
  - **rejected**: The operation has failed due to an error of some kind
